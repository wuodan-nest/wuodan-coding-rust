## How to Setup Rust Locally

1. **Install Rustup:**
   - The easiest way to install Rust is using `rustup`. 
   - Download and run the installer from the official Rust website: https://rustup.rs/
   - Follow the on-screen instructions.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `rustc --version` to check if Rust is installed correctly.

3. **Install Rust Analyzer (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Rust Analyzer is a powerful language server that provides excellent code completion, error checking, and refactoring support in your code editor.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your specific editor (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) from the Rust Analyzer website: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer

## Project Goals

* **Compile a high-quality learning resource:** Offer a comprehensive and well-structured set of exercises and examples to guide learners through the Rust programming language.
* **Continuously improve:** Regularly update and expand the content based on user feedback and the evolving Rust ecosystem.
* **Build Apps and Games:** Experiment with rust for building applicaitons' and softwares' for personal use.

**This is a personal repository for learning and experimentation.**
